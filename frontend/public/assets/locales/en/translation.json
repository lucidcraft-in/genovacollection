"about_us" : " Established in 1982 at a time when high quality footwear  models were seldom available, Genova arose as the first brand   for authentic, traditional footwear. It was indeed a valuable  addition to the market as it offered a variety of collections,   not merely calf leather (as per the norm), but varieties that  also included an assortment of rich leathers in an array of  exquisite designs. Inspired by their global excursions,   renowned Italian artisans interpreted hundreds of ideas, only  to shortlist a discerned few. Handcrafted with the utmost  attention to detail, these fine designs were carefully  selected as if Genova proprietors were cherry-picking them for  their own personal indulgence."
