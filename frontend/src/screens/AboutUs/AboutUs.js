                  Established in 1982 at a time when high quality footwear
                  models were seldom available, FARES arose as the first brand
                  for authentic, traditional footwear. It was indeed a valuable
                  addition to the market as it offered a variety of collections,
                  not merely calf leather (as per the norm), but varieties that
                  also included an assortment of rich leathers in an array of
                  exquisite designs. Inspired by their global excursions,
                  renowned Italian artisans interpreted hundreds of ideas, only
                  to shortlist a discerned few. Handcrafted with the utmost
                  attention to detail, these fine designs were carefully
                  selected as if FARESâ€™ proprietors were cherry-picking them for
                  their own personal indulgence.
